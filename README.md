#we would have to access to the main first in order to compile it
#Then, the way this is going to be compile it is going to be like: g++ main.cpp ../classes/*.cpp taking in count that the user is within file named "main". The file will be run as "./a.out", and the the following data from the csv files should be save on a "name_of_thefile".out

#Go the the file Input_out.txt to see a better illustration of all the data saved from the CSV files
#The files are going to be write it in the main where passenger and reservation is.


#For the final submission, none of my teammates actually said anything, I had to create the wiki all by myself and use #
#what I had because none of them pushed anything important. The only person who really contact me and asked me for
#help was ajay, this was because I wrote the main logic that it is being used for the project, so they could use it.
#and I had useful example code. We were actually able to get quite a lot stuff done together.
#as you can see in instructions the Example codes were written by me Nicolas.

## Airport Data Saver 
 The goal of this project was to build a program that reads data from a CSV file and organizes it into a new file based on its independent variable. I used hash tables as the main data structure and was able to successfully implement the solution. The program read the title of a CSV file, opens it up and grabs each one of the variables and stores it onto a txt file. It indexes on a format where it is easy to read.  
## Language 
  C++ 
## How to Run 
  - g++ main.cpp ../classes/*.cpp
